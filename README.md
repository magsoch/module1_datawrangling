# module1_datawrangling
All exercises was prepared by World Quant University for members of first module 'Data wrangling in python' Data Scientist track.
Exercises was fully done by me so if you are the member of next edition the same course please don't copy those thoughtlessly. 
It can be used though as an cookbook introduction to solving problems by data analysis in python.
